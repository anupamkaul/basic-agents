Use Conditional Includes in .gitconfig 

This method automatically switches your user.email and user.name based on the directory you are working in. 

Set Global Configuration: First, set your personal information as the default global settings in your main ~/.gitconfig file:

bash

git config --global user.name "Your Personal Name"
git config --global user.email "your_personal_email@example.com"

Create a Work-Specific Config File: Create a separate configuration file for your work projects, for example, ~/.gitconfig-work:

bash

# ~/.gitconfig-work
[user]
    name = Your Office Name
    email = your_office_email@office.com

Use includeIf: Back in your global ~/.gitconfig file, add an includeIf statement that applies the work configuration only when you are in your work directory (e.g., ~/Projects/Work/):

bash

# ~/.gitconfig
[user]
  name = Your Personal Name
  email = your_personal_email@example.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/Projects/Work/"]
  path=~/.gitconfig-work`

## Note: to get this to work, make sure there is NO SPACE between gitdir:<path> and path=<path>
## (relative paths worked for me but previously I had a space after path = <path> and I got the non-overriden email again
## Instead of relying on the actual git commit to work, use: git config user.email, and it should show you the right email ID

## (I used ~/gitconfig, added the includeIF at the END of the file, and I used ~/gitconfig.PERSONAL as the alternate override)
## Thus my default is the office and the override is the personal email ID (opposite of this text, and it works)
