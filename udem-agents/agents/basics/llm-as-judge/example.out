Question to ask:  You are an independent AI advisor asked by the mayor of a mid-sized coastal city of 150,000 that faces (a) projected sea‑level rise likely to inundate 10% of developed land within 30 years, (b) a 20% decline in tax revenue over 5 years due to industry closures, and (c) an incoming wave of 30,000 climate‑displaced people over 10 years; with an initial public investment of $500 million, design a prioritized 10‑year policy and investment plan that balances infrastructural resilience, affordable housing, economic revitalization, public health, and social cohesion—specify for each priority: concrete actions, estimated budgets and timelines, measurable metrics to evaluate success, major risks and failure modes, and how you would revise the plan annually as new data arrives; identify at least three ethically contentious trade‑offs your plan forces, explain your ethical reasoning for each, and provide a one‑paragraph public statement the mayor could use to explain and justify the plan to residents?
