If you rearrange the letters of the word "CONVERSATION," can you form exactly two new English words, each using all the letters without any repetition or omission? If so, what are those two words?
Let's analyze the problem carefully:

- The word is **"CONVERSATION"**.
- It has 12 letters: C, O, N, V, E, R, S, A, T, I, O, N.
- The question: Can you rearrange the letters to form **exactly two new English words**, each using all the letters without repetition or omission?

This essentially asks if the letters of "CONVERSATION" can be split into two words **whose combined letters exactly match the letters of "CONVERSATION"**.

---

### Step 1: Confirm the letter counts in "CONVERSATION"

Count each letter:

- C: 1
- O: 2
- N: 2
- V: 1
- E: 1
- R: 1
- S: 1
- A: 1
- T: 1
- I: 1

---

### Step 2: Look for two English words that combine to use exactly these letters

### Known anagrams and hints:

"CONVERSATION" is a well-known anagram of **"CONSERVATION."**

- **CONSERVATION** uses all the letters of CONVERSATION.
- This is one word, so it doesn’t fit the "two words" criterion.

---

### Step 3: Try to find two English words from these letters

Can the letters be rearranged into **two English words whose letters together make "CONVERSATION"**?

Try split combos (common shorter words from the letters):

- "CONSERVATION" is the base word (one word).
- Can it be divided into "CONSERVATION" (one word) and something else? No, that’s just one word.

Try common subsets:

- "CONSERVATION" is 12 letters — if split into two words, maybe:
  
  Possibility 1: "CONSERVATION" = "CONSERV" + "ATION" (no, "ation" is not standalone word)
  
  Possibility 2: Is "CONVERSATION" two words? No, it's one word.
  
- Try pairs such as:

  - "CONVERSATION" split into "CONVERSATION" (one word), no new words.
  
  - "CON SERVATION" (not a word)
  
  - "COVERSION" + "ANT" (not "coversion")
  
  - "CONVERSION" + "AT" (CONVERSION is a word, AT is a word)

Wait! Let's check if "CONVERSION" + "AT" works:

- Does "CONVERSION" + "AT" use all letters?

"CONVERSION":

- Letters: C O N V E R S I O N
- Count:
  - C(1), O(2), N(2), V(1), E(1), R(1), S(1), I(1)
- Length: 10 letters

Letters left for "AT":

- A, T (are these in the original?)

Original "CONVERSATION" has A and T.

Now, total letters:

- CONVERSION (10 letters) + AT (2 letters) = 12 letters total → matches total letters.

Let's check counts:

- CONVERSION uses C,O,N,V,E,R,S,I,O,N — yes, letters in original.
- Leftover letters: A and T for "AT."

Perfect!

So the two words:

- **CONVERSION** + **AT**

when combined, use all letters of "CONVERSATION."

---

### Step 4: Verify these are valid English words

- **CONVERSION** is an English word.
- **AT** is an English preposition.

---

### Final answer:

**Yes.** Rearranging the letters of **CONVERSATION** can form the two English words:

> **CONVERSION** and **AT**

Each using all letters with no omission or repetition.

---

# **Summary**

**"CONVERSION" + "AT"** use all letters of "CONVERSATION" exactly once.
